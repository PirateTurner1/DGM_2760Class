            <h2>About This Class</h2>
            <br>
            <p>This class was taken at Utah Valley University to help me learn more about coding with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
            This class was fun and unique and This course helped me be creative in my thinking as long as I stuck with the requirements.
            Each of these pages have something that you the user, can do. It ranges moving the screen size or pressing buttons, or even filling in your own information to complete the fun project. 
            Each page will have something listed that was either required, or something that I have learned from that week and from the Instructor. 
            Please, click on each page to see what I have been able to do through JavaScript. 
            <br><em><b>Please Note,</b></em> You will have to click the back button to come back to this main page. You may even have to refresh the page on some of them.
            Also, This is not meant for small devices as of yet!  These pages are best on a computer or laptop device.  The projects will not turn out to be very good otherwise.  
            It will turn out all jumbled and messy.
